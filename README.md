Deep-Learning-Speaker Classification
====================================

### Project Description ###

Project for a graduate-level deep learning course -- objective is to train a neural network to be able to recognize a speaker by their voice. So the problem being addressed first is not Speech Recognition but Speaker Classification.

Course Github Link: https://github.com/ml6973/Course

### Current Data Set ###

The data being used for this project can be found at: http://www.openslr.org/12/ . Openslr is an open source project dedicated to hosting speech and language resources, hoping to assist the progress of speech recognition.

### Previous Work Done ###

   1. Pannous is a project that is working on implementing Speech Recognition in Google's Tensorflow.

       To see more of an in-depth walkthrough of how Pannous approaches the speaker classification problem, please see `Pannous-Walkthrough.md`.
       
### Work To-Be-Done ###

   1. Implement `speaker_classifier_tflearn.py` using our dataset. For this to be completed, it is necessary to first rename / reorganize the dataset that we wish to use for the project. This is to be done first! More to be added as they are completed.
